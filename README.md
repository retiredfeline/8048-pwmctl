# 8048 MCU LED PWM controller

This is firmware for the [project on Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/185235-pwm-led-bench-light) using a [8048 board](https://github.com/retiredfeline/8048-board) for PWM control of 48 LEDs on a superseded [6-segment digit project](https://hackaday.io/project/175397-6-segment-2-digit-led-display-board) repurposed as a bench light. It's underkill as the firmware is only a couple of hundred bytes whereas those MCUs could do more (they used to be in 5Â¼ inch floppy controllers), but also overkill as a simple modern MCU driving a MOSFET switch could do the job. ðŸ˜‰
